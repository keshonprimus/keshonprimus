Hi, I'm Keshon Primus. 
I am a budding Computer Engineering student at the University of South Florida with high hopes of diving into the field of Software Engineering.
I'm particularly intersted in the research aspect of Computer Science. This includes modeling for topography and uncertainty and educational entertainment.
As a side note, I'm also an avid Marvel fan and a cat lover. 
Maine Coons are my favorite breed of cats and I firmly believe that Ironman is overrated, sorry.

This github will comprise of some of the projects that I have worked on during my tenure as an undergarduate student in Computer Engineering.
Feel free to browse them as I add to the library. Contributions and suggestions are also welcomed by all.
Thank you, and stay awesome, Gotham!
